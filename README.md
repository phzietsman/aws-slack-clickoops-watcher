# AWS ClickOops watcher for Slack
This deployment allows you to monitor your AWS accounts for changes being made in the console.

## Prerequisites
1. The solution has been built to be used in an AWS multi-account environment provisioned using [AWS Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/controltower). In Control Tower all CloudTrail logs are shipped to a central Log Archive account which simplifies the processing of these logs.

2. Additionally you will need a [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps)  with an incoming webhook configured.

## Post deployment
After deploying the solution you will need to set the SSM parameter containing the Slack Webhook URL manually. This is not set in code for security reasons.
